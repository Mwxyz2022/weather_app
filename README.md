## [Weather_app Netlify](https://main--weather-app-test01.netlify.app/)

### Project commands:

- `npm start` "Starting project"
- `npm run build` "Bundling project"

## Functionality:

My app provides weather information based on your current location or searched cities. Upon initial launch, the app requests access to your geolocation to display weather details for your current position. You can search for cities, and the app will display a list of matching locations. Selecting a city will show a detailed weather card for that location.

The app allows you to save locations as favorites for quick access.
